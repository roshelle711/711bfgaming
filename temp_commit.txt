v9: Multiplayer foundation with Colyseus

Phase 1 multiplayer implementation:
- Colyseus server (Node.js + TypeScript) on port 2567
- GameRoom with player state sync
- Client connects via WebSocket, renders other players
- Smooth interpolation for remote player movement
- Graceful fallback to single-player if server unavailable
- Shared day/night cycle across all clients

New files:
- server/ - Complete Colyseus server project
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture documentation
- scripts/start-dev.ps1 - Launch both servers
