# 711BF Gaming - Game Concept Brainstorm

## Vision Statement
*A cozy-yet-adventurous MMO that blends relaxing life-sim gameplay with survival crafting, meaningful combat, and a living world of AI-driven NPCs - playable solo or with friends.*

---

## Core Pillars (What Makes It Fun)

### 1. Cozy + Adventurous Balance
- Relaxed pace when you want it, exciting challenges when you seek them
- Safe zones for building/socializing, dangerous wilds for adventure
- No punishment for playing casually

### 2. Crafting, Building & Survival
- Gather resources, craft gear/items, build and decorate
- Base building (personal + group)
- Survival elements without being punishing (Valheim-style)

### 3. Exploration & Discovery
- Beautiful world that rewards curiosity
- Hidden areas, collectibles, lore, secrets
- Biomes with distinct identities and dangers

### 4. Real Combat & Dungeons
- Satisfying combat system (action-based like Enshrouded/Valheim)
- Dungeons and bosses for progression
- Optional but rewarding - not forced on cozy players

### 5. Living AI-Driven NPCs
- NPCs with daily schedules (work, eat, sleep, hobbies)
- Unique personalities and relationships
- React to world events, weather, seasons
- Remember player interactions
- Feel like real inhabitants, not quest dispensers

### 6. Companion NPCs
- Recruit NPCs to join your adventures
- They fight alongside you in dungeons/quests
- Relationships grow over time
- Different skills/personalities affect gameplay
- Can play solo and still have a "party" feel

### 7. Social & Co-op (MMO)
- Play solo, with friends, or meet strangers
- Group dungeons and world bosses
- Trading, guilds, shared community projects
- Visit each other's bases/homes

### 8. Meaningful Progression
- Skills/professions to level
- Gear tiers that feel rewarding
- Long-term goals (bosses, building projects, collections)
- Story milestones

### 9. Story & World
- NPCs with their own stories
- Overarching world narrative
- Player choices that matter?
- Lore to discover through exploration

## Setting: The Multi-Realm World

**Core Concept:** A connected world made up of distinct realms, each with its own aesthetic, tone, and secrets. NOT realistic/modern - stylized and original.

### The Realms (Biomes/Zones)

| Realm | Vibe | Tone |
|-------|------|------|
| **Shattered Isles** | Floating islands, sky bridges, wind magic | Bright, airy, adventurous |
| **The Bloom & Blight** | Lush nature vs creeping corruption | Contrast - pretty AND eerie |
| **Hollow Depths** | Underground caverns, bioluminescent, crystals | Mysterious, wonder, some dark |
| **Spirit Lands** | Spirit realm bleeds through, ethereal | Magical, haunting, beautiful |
| **The Old Garden** | Ancient ruins, overgrown giants, old magic | Melancholy, discovery, cozy pockets |

### How It Connects
- Hub world/starting zone that feels like home base?
- Portals, magical paths, or natural transitions between realms?
- Each realm unlocks through progression/story?
- Can revisit any realm freely once discovered?

### Puzzles Are Core!
- Environmental puzzles in each realm (Luma Island style)
- Co-op puzzles that require teamwork
- Hidden puzzle rooms with rewards
- Puzzles that use each realm's unique mechanics (wind in sky isles, light in depths, etc.)
- Mix of easy "figure it out" and challenging brain-teasers

## Player Identity & Opening

### World State: The Hybrid Approach
- World is **recovering**, not destroyed
- Lush and varied like Earth - forests, deserts, coasts, tundras, etc.
- NOT dead/post-apocalyptic looking
- Cozy communities exist, but realms still need help/exploration
- Balance of "things are okay" and "there's work to do"

### The Starting Town
A **coastal hub town** - mix of cozy fishing village vibes and bustling port activity. This is home base, safety, and where your adventure begins. How you arrived depends on your origin choice...

### Character Origin (Player Chooses One of Three)

| Origin | Who You Are | Opening Scene | Dialogue Flavor |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Survivor** | Local whose home was destroyed in The Event | Start on outskirts of town, rebuilding | "I lost everything... but I'm still here." |
| **Traveler** | From a distant land, seeking a fresh start | Arrive by ship OR portal (player picks) | "I came here looking for something new." |
| **The Fallen** | Mysterious, fell from the sky, fragmented memory | Wake in an NPC's cottage after falling through a rift | "I don't remember... but I fell from above." |

**All three origins converge quickly:**
- Same starting town
- Same tutorial experience
- Same game - just different personal narrative flavor
- Occasional unique dialogue callbacks ("Ah, you're the one who fell from the sky!")

### Character Customization
- Appearance (body, face, hair, etc.)
- Origin choice (above)
- Class/role? Or classless with flexible skills?

### Outfit & Gear System
Players can save and swap between **outfit sets** for different activities:

| Outfit Type | Purpose | Examples |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Combat Gear** | Adventuring, dungeons, bosses | Armor, weapons, shields |
| **Gathering Gear** | Mining, logging, harvesting | Pickaxe, axe, gathering clothes |
| **Farming Gear** | Planting, watering, animals | Overalls, straw hat, tools |
| **Casual/Social** | Hanging out, towns, events | Fashion! Dresses, suits, fun outfits |
| **Crafting Gear** | Bonuses to crafting? | Aprons, gloves, goggles |

**Features:**
- Quick-swap between saved outfits (hotkey or menu)
- Outfits are cosmetic + functional (combat stats, gathering bonuses, etc.)
- Transmog/glamour system? (Look how you want, keep the stats)
- Wardrobe storage for collecting outfits

## Combat Design

### Style: WoW-Inspired But Streamlined
- Action bar with abilities (6-8 core skills, not 30)
- Roles exist (tank/healer/damage) but not rigid
- Can solo most content with NPC companions
- Group content rewards coordination

### Difficulty Tiers
| Tier | For Who |
|------|---------|
| **Story Mode** | Relaxed, enjoy the narrative, can't really fail |
| **Normal** | Standard challenge, learn mechanics |
| **Challenging** | Requires strategy, gear, coordination |
| **Heroic/Mythic?** | Endgame bragging rights, best rewards |

### What Makes It Fun
- Satisfying to hit things (good feedback, effects)
- Learn enemy patterns
- Dungeons have mechanics but not overwhelming
- Bosses feel epic without being impossible

---

## Platform & Technical Decisions

### Platform Target
- **PC first** (Steam) - primary focus
- Console (Nintendo/Xbox) - maybe later, not decided
- Web-based prototype - YES, for early testing

### PvE + PvP
- **PvE**: Core experience, dungeons, world bosses, story content
- **PvP**: Optional but available! (Arenas? Designated zones? Duels?)

### Realm Travel
- **Portals**: Fast travel between major hubs
- **Paths**: Walkable/rideable routes between areas
- **Flight**: Unlockable? Mounts? Gliders? (TBD)
- **Mounts**: Yes! Walking and riding

## Open Questions to Explore

### MMO Scale
- Small servers (10-50) - tight community, easier technically
- Medium (100-500) - village/town feel
- Large (1000+) - complex, needs instancing

### NPC Intelligence Depth
- Basic schedules + dialogue?
- Memory of player actions?
- Dynamic relationships that evolve?
- Fully autonomous AI agents? (ambitious!)

### Combat Style
- Hack and slash (Valheim)?
- More tactical/skill-based (Enshrouded)?
- Class-based or freeform?

### PvP Details
- Open world PvP zones?
- Opt-in duels only?
- Arenas/battlegrounds?
- Faction-based?

## The "Living World" NPC Feature (Deep Dive)

This feels like a signature feature - here's what it could look like:

### Daily Life
- NPCs wake up, eat breakfast, go to work/tasks
- Take breaks, socialize with each other
- Evening activities (tavern, hobbies, visiting friends)
- Sleep at night (or different schedules for night owls)

### Personality & Memory
- Each NPC has traits (shy, adventurous, grumpy, cheerful)
- They remember what you've done for them
- Relationships build over time (friendship, trust, maybe romance?)
- React differently based on your reputation

### As Companions
- Ask NPCs to join your party
- They have combat styles and abilities
- Banter during exploration
- React to discoveries and danger
- Level up or improve with you

### World Reactions
- NPCs react to weather ("Beautiful day!" vs staying inside during storms)
- Seasonal activities and festivals
- React to world events (monster attacks, celebrations)
- Gossip and spread news

## Development Preferences

### UX Principles
- **Minimize clicks to gameplay** - Consolidate setup screens where possible without cluttering
- **Respect player time** - Skip unnecessary confirmations, provide quick-start options
- **Character presets** - Let players save favorite configurations for quick game starts
- **Smooth onboarding** - Tutorial should feel like playing, not reading

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Dialog boxes should auto-resize to fit content
- Avoid tiny text - readability matters
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Visual feedback for all interactions (hover states, click feedback)
- Loading states should be clear but unobtrusive

### Technical Preferences
- Canvas should scale to browser window (game world stays fixed size)
- Smooth movement with subtle acceleration (not instant velocity changes)
- Target 60fps - optimize aggressively if needed
- Prefer Phaser's built-in systems over custom solutions where possible

### Character Creation Philosophy
- Combine screens where logical (class + appearance + pet on one screen if not cluttered)
- Randomize button for quick character generation
- Pre-filled defaults for faster testing during development
- Allow name input (not just preset names)
- Save up to 3 character presets for returning players

### Feature Implementation Notes
- Check DONE.md before implementing - understand existing systems
- Prefer extending existing code over parallel implementations
- Document where key features live in code (file:line references in DONE.md)

## Next Steps
1. Nail down the setting/theme
2. Decide MMO scale (recommend starting smaller)
3. Prioritize features for a "minimum fun version"
4. Explore beginner-friendly game engines
5. Think about what makes YOUR game unique
